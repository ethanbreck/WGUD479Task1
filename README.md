This project page is to fufill part of task 1 for D479

## Timeline Items:

1. Check statistics of people returning vs new tourists, and average income of people visiting.
2. check the 'about the island' details
3. using the details between the two supplied documents, create seperate personas for new tourists, repeat tourists with opportunties for events like exotic weddings and honeymoons, opportunities for business, and plans for expansion for the island. 
4. Create wireframes for the different personas and pages
5. use social media forum board sites to do guerrilla usability testing, and recieve feedback
6. Use github to host interactive website for tanitian website, with properly cited documents.

I need to look at usability testing content to ensure that I have tasks available for people to test for task 2 as well.

## Persona Profile:




Based on the Survey results, a majority of people going to the island are family vacations or regular vacations. If the Island is foucsing on larger annual income groups coming to the island, focusing on couples going to the island, and honeymoon or wedding services, on a larger portion of the island, with some amenities for family vacations. A fair number of people coming back for repeat vacations are higher income couples not on a family vacation. A group of private condos or private houses on the island or on an island close by, simlar to Mo'orea, which is 12 nautical miles away would provide a fair amount of tourism to the region. Between the private condos, which would increase the odds of couples vacationing to return.
