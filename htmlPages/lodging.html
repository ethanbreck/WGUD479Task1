    <p>The island has a few options for lodging. The island has a few hotels in the downtown area, within a 15 minute drive from the airport. The island also has a few private gated condo communities that are owned and operated by a few of the major hotel groups, for a slightly more secluded and personal experience on the island. The condos are a further 15 minute drive from the island downtown area. Those renting condos are heavily recommended to rent mopeds or other rental vehicles for their duration on the island. </p>
